# Migration Map

[Run the Migration Application](./main.html)

I've created an interactive Geographic Journey Map showing the MacQuarrie clan's diaspora from Ulva across the globe. Here are the key features:

**Interactive Elements:**

-   Animated migration routes that show populations moving from Ulva to Australia, Canada, USA, and New Zealand
-   Four distinct migration phases based on historical events (1794-present)
-   Color-coded arrows showing different migration waves
-   Hover over settlement locations to see detailed stories and notable landmarks

**Timeline Phases:**

1.  **1794-1820s**: Loss of Ulva & Early Emigration (featuring Lachlan MacQuarrie's journey to Australia)
2.  **1830s-1850s**: Highland Clearances & Mass Migration (peak diaspora period)
3.  **1860s-1900s**: Established Communities (prosperity in new lands)
4.  **1920s-Present**: Global Clan Network (modern connections)

**Controls:**

-   Play/Pause button to animate the migration waves
-   Reset button to start over
-   Click on any timeline phase to jump to that period
-   Hover over locations for settlement stories and notable place names

The map uses the MacQuarrie tartan colors (red, green, amber) and shows how the clan spread from their ancestral island home to become a truly global family, maintaining their heritage across continents.
