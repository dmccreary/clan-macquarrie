3. Volcanic eruptions destroyed them
4. Disease killed them all
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"

1. Earthquakes
2. Limited arable land, thin soils, Atlantic storms, and short growing seasons
3. Tornadoes
4. Hurricanes
</div>

## Economic History

#### What type of economy did the clan have?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Industrial manufacturing
2. Subsistence agriculture, cattle raising, and fishing
3. Banking and finance

??? question "Show Answer"

3. Irish clans were exactly the same
4. Scottish clans didn't have chiefs
