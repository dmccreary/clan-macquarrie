</div>
<details class="question">
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
<p>The correct answer is <strong>2</strong>. Ulva is a small island about 4.5 miles long and 2 miles wide, located just off the west coast of Mull in Scotland's Inner Hebrides. It has rocky coastlines, rolling hills, moorland, and beautiful but harsh landscapes shaped by the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
</details>

</div>
<details class="question">

<p>The correct answer is <strong>3</strong>. You take a ferry from Oban to Mull (45 minutes), drive across Mull (45 minutes), then take a small passenger ferry across the narrow strait to Ulva (5 minutes). The small ferry only operates during daylight hours and in good weather.</p>

<p>The correct answer is <strong>3</strong>. Only about 5-10 people live permanently on Ulva today. At its peak in the late 1700s, the island supported 600-850 people. This dramatic population collapse happened due to the Highland Clearances.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-difference-between-scottish-and-irish-clans">What's the difference between Scottish and Irish clans?</h4>
<div class="upper-alpha">
<ol>
<li>There is no difference</li>
<li>Scottish clans had more formalized hierarchical structures with recognized chiefs</li>
<li>Irish clans were exactly the same</li>
<li>Scottish clans didn't have chiefs</li>
</ol>
</div>
<details class="question">
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
<p>The correct answer is <strong>2</strong>. Both systems are based on kinship and shared territory, but Scottish clans developed a more formalized hierarchical structure with recognized chiefs, while Irish clans (called "septs") had somewhat different organizational patterns. Both were eventually destroyed by English government policies.</p>
</details>
<h4 id="are-there-any-macquarrie-castles">Are there any MacQuarrie castles?</h4>
<div class="upper-alpha">
<ol>
<li>Yes, hundreds</li>
<li>No major castles—only the modest chief's residence ruins remain</li>
<li>Yes, one giant castle</li>
<li>They lived in caves</li>
</ol>
</div>
<details class="question">
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
<p>The correct answer is <strong>2</strong>. No major castles. The MacQuarrie chiefs' residence on Ulva was substantial but not a castle like those of wealthier clans. Only stone foundations remain today. The clan's modest resources didn't permit building or maintaining elaborate fortifications.</p>

<div class="upper-alpha">
<ol>
<li>All are perfectly preserved</li>
<li>Many were lost due to clan dispersal and poverty</li>
<li>They were all burned intentionally</li>
<li>They never kept records</li>
</ol>
</div>
<details class="question">
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
<p>The correct answer is <strong>2</strong>. Many records were lost or destroyed over time due to clan dispersal, lack of resources to maintain archives, and the general poverty following the loss of Ulva. Some records survive in Scottish archives, but much of the clan's history survives primarily through oral tradition and genealogical reconstruction.</p>
</details>
<h4 id="can-the-macquarrie-chiefship-be-restored">Can the MacQuarrie chiefship be restored?</h4>
<div class="upper-alpha">
<ol>
<li>Never</li>
<li>Theoretically yes, with proof of descent and recognition from the Lord Lyon</li>
<li>It already has been</li>
<li>Only if Scotland becomes independent</li>
</ol>
</div>
<details class="question">
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
<p>The correct answer is <strong>2</strong>. Theoretically, if someone could prove direct descent from the last chief and gain recognition from the Lord Lyon King of Arms (Scotland's heraldic authority), the chiefship could be restored. However, this hasn't happened, and Clan MacQuarrie currently has no recognized chief.</p>
