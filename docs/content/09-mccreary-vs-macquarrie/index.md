# The McCreary Surname from Northern Ireland: A Detailed History

People with the "McCreary" surname are often unrelated to the MacQuarrie clan.  Based on comprehensive research, here's what we know about the McCreary surname and its Northern Ireland roots:

## Etymology and Meaning

The surname McCreary is an Anglicized form of the Gaelic "Mac Ruidhrí" or "Mac Ruaidhrí," meaning "son of Ruaidhrí." The personal name Ruaidhrí is composed of two Gaelic elements: "ruadh" (meaning "red") and "rí" (meaning "king"), thus translating to "red king."

## Scottish Origins: The Galloway Connection

The McCreary name originates from the Galloway District in southwest Scotland, specifically from the counties of Kirkcudbrightshire and Wigtownshire. The family is considered a branch of the McCririck family, which often spelled the name as MacCririe.

There is a tradition that the founder of the family was named "de Carrick" and took the name "de Rerik" when given the Barony at Rerrick (or Rerwick) in Kirkcudbrightshire. Over the centuries, the name evolved through various spellings: de Rerik → McRerik → McCrerik → McCrerie → McCrery → McCreery.

## Historical Scottish Records

Early Scottish records show John McCrery as a follower of the Earl of Cassilis in 1526, and Thomas McCrery holding half a tenement in Dumfries in 1444. The McCririck family possessed lands at Kirkconnel on the west side of the River Nith, extending six square miles, and also owned lands in Glenscordale on the Island of Arran.

## The Ulster Plantation (Early 1600s)

This is where the Northern Ireland connection becomes critical:

The Plantation of Ulster began after 1603 when James VI of Scotland became James I of England. The plantation aimed to settle Protestant Scots and English colonists in Ulster, confiscating lands from the native Irish Catholic population. The majority of Scottish settlers came from southwest Scotland, particularly from Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, and Dumfries and Galloway.

During the Scottish Plantation of Northern Ireland in the early 1600s, a large number of McCreerys (and variant spellings) were included in the plantation. These were Lowland Scots from Galloway, not Highland Scots.

## Settlement Patterns in Ulster

Scottish settlement was heaviest in north Antrim, northeast Down, east Donegal, and northwest Tyrone. The official plantation affected six counties: Armagh, Cavan, Coleraine (renamed Londonderry), Donegal, Fermanagh, and Tyrone.

McCrearys have been found in most of the counties in Ulster Province, with many settling near Strabane in the northwestern part of County Tyrone. These were Presbyterian Lowland Scots, not to be confused with the Highland Scots of "bagpipes and kilts."

## The Scotch-Irish Identity

The McCrearys were among the Presbyterian Scots who settled in Northern Ireland. These Ulster Scots coexisted with Irish Catholics for several generations, though there was frequent conflict.

The migration between Scotland and Ireland wasn't new—the voyage across the North Channel of the Irish Sea was only 12 miles at the closest points, and there had been frequent migration in both directions for centuries as economic conditions changed.

## Why They Left Scotland

Scotland was almost an impoverished nation in the early 1600s, functioning effectively as a peasant economy. The offer of land in Ulster provided opportunities that were hard to refuse for struggling Scottish farmers and laborers.

## Emigration to America (1700s)

In the 18th century, when the original 100-year leases expired, English landlords dramatically raised rents. The descendants of the Scottish settlers, accustomed to cheap rents and true to their Scottish heritage, refused to pay. Combined with religious conflicts, tithing requirements for the Anglican Church they didn't attend, and promises of opportunity in the New World, this triggered massive Scotch-Irish emigration to America.

Several McCrearys came to America in the 1720s and settled in Pennsylvania, particularly in York County and later Bedford County. One family tradition mentions three McCreary brothers—Thomas, William, and John—arriving around 1720 from County Antrim.

## Relationship to Clan MacQuarrie

This is an important distinction: **The McCreary surname from Northern Ireland is NOT directly connected to Clan MacQuarrie.**

Here's why:

1. **Geographic Origin**: McCrearys came from Galloway in southwest Scotland (Lowlands), while Clan MacQuarrie was from the Isle of Ulva off Mull in the Inner Hebrides (Highlands).

2. **Different Etymology**: While both names sound similar in English, they have different Gaelic origins:
   - McCreary = Mac Ruidhrí/Mac Ruaidhrí (from Galloway/Lowland tradition)
   - MacQuarrie = Mac Guaire (from Highland clan tradition)

3. **Cultural Differences**: The Ulster McCrearys were Presbyterian Lowland Scots, not Highland Scots. Clan MacQuarrie was a Highland clan with Catholic/Episcopalian traditions and Gaelic culture.

4. **Migration Timing**: The McCrearys migrated to Ulster during the organized Plantation (1609-1690s), while any MacQuarrie members who might have gone to Ulster would have done so later, after Culloden (1746) and the sale of Ulva (1794).

## Spelling Variations

Common spelling variations of the name include: McCreary, McCreery, McCrorie, McCrory, MacCririe, MacCreery, MacCrory, McCrery, McCrary, and MacCrire.

## Summary

The McCreary surname in Northern Ireland represents part of the Scotch-Irish (Ulster Scots) heritage—Presbyterian Lowland Scots from the Galloway region who were settled in Ulster during the Plantation period beginning in 1609. While the name sounds similar to MacQuarrie, they are distinct surnames from different regions of Scotland with different cultural backgrounds. The McCrearys became a foundational part of the Ulster Protestant community and later contributed significantly to the settlement of colonial America, particularly Pennsylvania and other Mid-Atlantic and Southern states.
