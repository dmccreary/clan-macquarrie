<p>Personas for the Clan MacQuarrie website:</p>
<p>I want to build a new website about the history of the Clan MacQuarrie.  This focus of the website is education about the Clan MacQuarrie and its role in the history of Scotland.  I want the site to be useful as a resource for schools teaching the history of Scotland as well and people that are doing research into their Scottish background.</p>
<p>Please help me describe the personas of people that might be using this website.  Include history students, teachers, people doing historical research, and people doing research into their own personal genealogy.  Include people that might want to travel to Scotland and visit the island of Ulva were the clan people lived.  Include people interested in the geography of the land and the climate of the area when the clan lived there.</p>
<p>For each persona, describe the persona in detail and crate a detailed list of questions they might have and the types of information they are looking for.  List the personas in the frequency order you predict they will arrive at the site.  This information can then be used to help organize the site top-level navigation.</p>
