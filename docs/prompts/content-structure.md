## Implementation Notes

**Homepage Priority:** Feature clear pathways to the three most common user needs: Family History Research, Visit Scotland, and Clan History.

**Mobile Optimization:** Ensure navigation works well on mobile devices, as many users will access while traveling.

**Search Functionality:** Robust search is critical given the diverse user needs and deep content.

**Cross-linking:** Extensive internal linking between related topics (e.g., linking from Jacobite Period to specific chiefs, from Visit Scotland to Geography sections).

**Progressive Disclosure:** Use expandable sections for detailed information so users can find what they need without overwhelming them.

**Visual Navigation Aids:** Use icons, images, or color coding to help users quickly identify sections relevant to their interests.

This structure prioritizes the most common user personas (genealogy researchers and heritage tourists) in the primary navigation while ensuring all persona needs are met through logical grouping and clear pathways to specialized content.
