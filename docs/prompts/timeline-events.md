    Please generate a list of 100 key events related to the Clan MacQuarrie and the history of Scotland.  Place these events into a JSON file that would be usable by a JavaScript Timeline viewing tool.  Make sure to include events such as the Battle of Culloden that impacted the clan system.



    I've created a comprehensive JSON file with 100 key events covering Clan MacQuarrie history and broader Scottish history. The timeline includes:
Key highlights:

Clan Origins (1164-1400s): Events related to Somerled and the establishment of MacQuarrie on Ulva
Medieval Scotland (843-1600s): Formation of Scotland and major historical events
Jacobite Era (1689-1746): Including the crucial Battle of Culloden where Chief Allan MacQuarrie fought and died
Post-Culloden Decline (1746-1794): Cultural suppression and the eventual sale of Ulva
Lachlan Macquarrie Era (1792-1824): The famous "Father of Australia" and his governorship
Highland Clearances & Diaspora (1796-1890s): The dispersal of clan members worldwide
Modern Era (1900s-2024): Clan societies, gatherings, and heritage preservation

The JSON structure is designed to work with JavaScript timeline libraries like TimelineJS, Vis-timeline, or similar tools. Each event includes:

Unique ID

You can easily import this into any timeline visualization tool that accepts JSON data!Retry
