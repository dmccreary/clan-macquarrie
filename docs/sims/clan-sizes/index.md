**Note:** The Battle of Culloden took place on April 16, 1746 (not 1750). "Fighting men" refers to the number of warriors a clan could field for battle, not total clan population. Total population would typically be 4-5 times the number of fighting men when including women, children, and elderly.

According to your document, Chief Allan MacQuarrie led the clan to support Prince Charles Edward Stuart in 1745, fought at Culloden where the clan suffered heavy casualties, and died shortly after the battle. This marked the beginning of the clan's decline, with the last chief selling the ancestral island of Ulva in 1794 due to financial pressures.
