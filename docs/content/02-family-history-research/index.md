# Researching Clan MacQuarrie Ancestry

Do you think you might be related to other members of the MacQuarrie?
Here is a step-by-step guide you can use.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Check Your Surname

Determine if your surname is a variant of MacQuarrie. The clan has over 100 established spelling variants, including:

**Common variants:** MacQuarrie, MacQuarie, McQuarrie, McQuarie, Quarry, MacQuaire, MacWharrie, Wharrie

**Less obvious variants:** Corry, Gurr, Gorey, Crary, Query, Querry, MacGorrie, McGorry, MacGuire, Maguire

**Historical spellings:** M'Quarrie, M'Goyre, M'Gourie, Makquhurrie, and many others

Even if your surname doesn't obviously resemble MacQuarrie, check the complete list of variants, as some differ dramatically from the original Gaelic "Mac Guaire."

### Step 2: Gather Family Information

Collect as much information as possible about your ancestors:

**Essential details:**
- Full names (including maiden names)
- Birth, marriage, and death dates
- Locations where they lived
- Occupations
- Religious affiliations

**Additional helpful information:**
- Family stories or legends passed down through generations
- Any mentions of Scottish heritage
- Immigration records (if ancestors left Scotland)
- Old family documents, letters, or photographs

**Important note:** Start with your immediate family—parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents—and work backward systematically.

### Step 3: Identify Geographic Connections

Research whether your ancestors came from areas associated with Clan MacQuarrie:

**Primary MacQuarrie territories:**
- Isle of Ulva (ancestral seat)
- Isle of Mull
- Staffa and Gometra islands
- Inner Hebrides region
- Argyllshire

**Key periods for migration:**
- 1790s: Sale of Ulva and initial dispersals
- 1830s-1850s: Major emigration to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and United States
- Post-1746: After the Battle of Culloden and Highland Clearances

If your ancestors came from these regions or emigrated during these periods, this strengthens the connection.

### Step 4: Conduct Traditional Genealogical Research

Use available records to trace your family tree:

**Scottish resources:**
- **Scotland's People** (scotlandspeople.gov.uk): Official government genealogy website with over 100 million records
  - Birth, marriage, and death records from 1553
  - Census records from 1841-1911
  - Wills dating back to 1500
  - Old parish records

- **National Records of Scotland**: Family, business, and church records

- **Mitchell Library (Glasgow)**: Family histories, voter rolls, street directories, emigrant lists

**International resources:**
- **Ancestry.com**: Largest database with 20+ million users
- **FamilySearch.org**: Free records from around the world
- **MyHeritage**: International genealogy platform
- **FindMyPast**: UK and Irish records

**Immigration records:**
- Ships' passenger lists
- Naturalization records
- Border crossing records

### Step 5: Research Clan MacQuarrie History

Learn about the clan to identify potential connections:

**Key historical facts:**
- First recorded chief: John Macquarrie of Ulva (died 1473)
- Alliance with Clan MacLean from 1452
- Heavy losses at Battle of Inverkeithing (1651)
- Supported Jacobite Rising of 1745
- Last chief: Lachlan MacQuarrie of Ulva (1716-1818)
- Famous descendant: Major-General Lachlan Macquarrie, "Father of Australia" (Governor 1810-1821)

**Historical records to search:**
- Gaelic Manuscript 1467 (National Library of Scotland)
- Clan genealogies compiled by Lt. Colonel Charles MacQuarrie
- Johnson and Boswell's 1773 tour accounts
- Jacobite rolls and military records

### Step 6: Consider DNA Testing

DNA testing can confirm or reveal MacQuarrie ancestry:

**Types of DNA tests:**

**Y-DNA testing (males only):**
- Traces direct paternal line (father to father)
- Most useful for surname research
- Recommended: 37-marker test minimum (upgradeable to 67 or 111)
- Can match you with other MacQuarrie descendants
- Identifies your haplogroup

**Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA):**
- Traces direct maternal line (mother to mother)
- Available for both males and females
- Less useful for surname research since surnames follow paternal lines

**Autosomal DNA:**
- Tests all ancestral lines
- Covers approximately last 5-7 generations (150-200 years)
- Best for finding living relatives
- Provides ethnicity estimates
- Most popular test type

**Recommended testing companies:**
- **Ancestry DNA**: Largest database (20+ million), best for finding matches
- **FamilyTreeDNA**: Best for Y-DNA testing, Scottish DNA Project available
- **23andMe**: Good ethnicity estimates and health information
- **MyHeritage**: Strong international database
- **LivingDNA**: Detailed British Isles regional breakdowns

**Important advice:** Test with multiple companies or upload results to other platforms to maximize matches. Transfer raw data where possible.

### Step 7: Join DNA Projects and Societies

Connect with other researchers:

**DNA Projects:**
- **Scottish Y-DNA Project** (FamilyTreeDNA): Largest Scottish genetic genealogy project
- **MacQuarrie Family Tree DNA Group**: Specific to MacQuarrie surname variants
- Analyze your results against known MacQuarrie genetic markers

**Clan societies and organizations:**
- **Clan MacQuarrie Society**: International organization for descendants
- **Scottish Clan Association**: Umbrella organization
- Local Scottish heritage societies in your country

**Benefits of joining:**
- Access to shared research and genealogies

### Step 8: Verify Your Connection

Analyze all evidence to confirm your MacQuarrie ancestry:

**Strong evidence includes:**
- Direct paper trail to MacQuarrie ancestors from Ulva or Mull
- Y-DNA matches with documented MacQuarrie descendants
- Surname variant found in historical MacQuarrie territories
- Family stories mentioning Ulva, Mull, or MacQuarrie connections
- Connection to known MacQuarrie families (e.g., Lachlan Macquarrie lineage)

**Important considerations:**
- Not all people with MacQuarrie surnames are blood descendants—some were affiliated families who adopted the name
- Surnames sometimes changed due to anglicization or clerical errors
- Multiple unrelated families may have adopted similar surnames

**Professional help:**
- Consider hiring a professional genealogist specializing in Scottish ancestry
- Consult with genetic genealogy experts for complex DNA questions
- Contact Scottish archives for assistance with difficult records

### Step 9: Document Your Findings

Create a comprehensive record of your research:

**Recommended documentation:**

## Common Misconceptions about Surname Spelling

Here are several common points of confusion that arise from the historical records concerning the MacQuarrie surname.

## Common Misconceptions About the Anglicisation of the Surname MacQuarrie

### 1. **Assumption of a Single "Correct" Spelling**

One misconception is that there is one proper anglicised spelling of the name. The MacQuarrie surname is very ancient and of Scottish Gaelic origin, making a precisely accurate translation to the English language impossible. The name has developed into numerous legitimate variants over centuries of migration and anglicisation.

### 2. **Belief That "MacQuarrie" is the Original Form**

MacQuarrie is actually an anglicisation of the Gaelic `Mac Guaire`, which was a patronymic form meaning `son of Guaire`. The original Gaelic form predates all anglicised versions, and historical records show early spellings like `M'Goyre` and `M'Gourie` that bear little resemblance to modern forms.

### 3. **Misunderstanding the Meaning**

The personal name Guaire derives from the early Gaelic `gaurio-s`, which is related to the Greek `gauros`, 
both meaning noble or proud. Some might mistakenly connect the name to other English words based on phonetic similarity.

### 4. **Oversimplification of Variant Development**

Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to "develop" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling. Variants weren't simply misspellings but evolved through regional pronunciation differences, literacy levels of record-keepers, and deliberate adaptations by families in different locations.

### 5. **Confusion About Completely Different-Looking Variants**

In the Isle of Man the name has become Quarry, and in Ireland, Gorey. Many people don't realize that names like Quarry, Wharrie, Corry, and even Gurr are legitimate MacQuarrie variants, despite appearing completely unrelated to the original.

### 6. **Assumption That All Variants Share Blood Descent**

Among MacQuarrie families would be both lineal descendants of the clan and dependent families who affiliated with the clan and thus adopted the clan name. Not everyone with a MacQuarrie surname variant necessarily descends from the same bloodline.
