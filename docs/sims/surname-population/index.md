**Key Historical Factors:**

**1400-1745: Slow Growth**
- Clan established on Ulva around 1400 with estimated 150 people
- Gradual population increase through clan expansion
- Alliance with MacLeans (1452) strengthened position
- Peak pre-Culloden population around 680 (1715)

**1746: Culloden Impact**
- Battle of Culloden and Chief Allan MacQuarrie's death caused significant casualties
- Population dropped approximately 15% due to battle losses and aftermath
- Estimated decline from 680 to 580

**1750-1850: Recovery and Diaspora Begins**
- Financial difficulties led to sale of Ulva (1794)
- Highland Clearances (1796-1850s) dispersed population
- Emigration to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and United States
- Despite clearances, global population began increasing through diaspora
- Lachlan MacQuarrie's fame in Australia (1810-1824) raised profile

**1850-1900: Rapid Diaspora Growth**
- Mass emigration during Highland Potato Famine (1846-1857)
- Establishment in new countries led to population expansion
- Population multiplied approximately 3.4x to 8,500

**1900-2000: Global Expansion**
- World Wars had impact but diaspora continued growing
- MacQuarrie Clan Society formation (1950s) helped maintain identity
- Digital age (1990s-2000s) connected global descendants
- Population approximately doubled to 50,000

**Note:** These are conservative estimates. Actual numbers may be higher, especially in recent centuries, as some variant surnames diverged significantly from the original clan name and may not identify with MacQuarrie heritage. Common surnames like "Maguire," "Corry," "Quarry," and "McCreary" have multiple origins beyond Clan MacQuarrie.
