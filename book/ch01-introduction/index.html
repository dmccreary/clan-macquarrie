<h1 id="chapter-i-introduction">Chapter I: Introduction</h1>
<p>Historical research has found the beginnings and development of most Scottish Clans to be a very knotty problem. This is especially true of the MacQuarries. One reason is the Clan is very old; one of the 3 or 4 most ancient in Scotland. Its origins are enshrouded in the mists of great antiquity and references to it in history are few, scattered and obscure. Clan MacQuarrie was small in size and power compared to the MacLeans, MacGregors and MacDonalds. Instead of leading ambitious schemes of conquest, the MacQuarrie Chiefs were allies and supporters of others, first the MacDonalds, later the MacLeans of Duart.</p>
<p>Another difficulty is that many of the most important records of the Clan were destroyed. Smibert says, "Most of the family papers of the MacQuarries were destroyed by fire in 1688, leaving the annals of the family more dubious than they might otherwise have been."[53].</p>
<p>In records the name is spelled in a variety of ways. The most common are: MacQuarrie, MacGuarie and Macquaire, derived from ancient Gaelic form MacGuidhre. Some believe that the name was derived from the adjective "quarrie", which means "noble", so they would use a small q, Macquarrie. Others thinking the family ancestor was Guarie, a prince of the Alpine line, prefer the spelling "MacGuairie" or "MacQuarrie". The capital G/Q indicates derivation from the name of a person rather than an adjective.</p>
<p>By ancient tradition the MacQuarries were closely related to the MacKinnons, and less closely to the MacDonalds of Sleat [whose tartan is very similar to the MacQuarrie tartan with a double green strip replacing a single one]. Except for the sparseness of genealogical records in the Islands, it is fortunate for the student that for many centuries the MacQuarries were active mainly in the region of the Isle of Ulva. Long before the 18th century this hardy breed of Highlanders held the isles of Ulva, Staffa, Little Colonsay and a part of Mull.</p>
<p>The name "Ulva" means in Norse "wolves." Did this refer to wolves infesting the island at an early date or to the fierce, wolfish character of people who lived there? Anyway MacQuarries were reputed to be a rough, turbulent lot, always ready for a "quaich of whiskey or a foray." They fought equally well with bow and arrow, long two-handed sword or battle-axe. Described as "the most acquisitive raiders who ever purloined barley", they were "bad soldiers, but good plunderers." Bad not as fighters, but in their unwillingness to submit to ordinary military discipline.</p>
<p>The MacQuarrie emblem was the pine tree, a variety best able to resist a strong gale. The crest depicted a dagger held aloft, ready to strike and the war-cry was a blood-curdling yell in Gaelic: "An far m breac deag," which is best translated, "Here come the red-spattered tartans."</p>
<p>In putting down the Jacobite uprisings of 1715 and especially 1745, the English took strong repressive measures against the Clans. Highlanders were forbidden to carry arms, wear kilts or play bagpipes. The prohibition of the kilt lasted until 1782. The status of Chiefs changed radically in 1747 when hereditary jurisdictions were abolished. This meant they were dispossessed</p>
<p><img alt="Kilbrenan Farm with Ulva in background" src="image-01.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Isle of Ulva" src="image-02.png" /></p>
<p>of their legal position as magistrates, adjudicating disputes of their people. Many chiefs got monetary compensation and continued living on ancestral lands, using this money to bring needed improvements in agriculture. In many instances the Chiefs' prestige as heads of Clans was not greatly diminished. This was case with Lachlan MacQuarrie (1715-1818), last hereditary Chief of the MacQuarries of Ulva. The Island was not taken from him until sold at public auction in 1777, to pay off long standing mortgages.</p>
<p>Many of the MacQuaries continued to stay on Ulva as tenants of the new owner; others emigrated to Canada and the United States. Later some settled in New South Wales (NSW) and the Far East. As time passed they scattered over the earth, giving a good account of themselves. A large number of them came to hold positions of prominence and influence in all walks of life.</p>
<p>Two MacQuarries best known to history were the last chief and Major General Lachlan Macquarie (1761-1824), the great Governor of NSW. Confusion arises since they had the same name and they were cousins, not father and son as has been sometimes said.</p>
<p>Chief Lachlan achieved immortality by being mentioned at some length by James Boswell and Dr. Johnson in their Journal of 1773. The Chief was their genial host overnight and the Journal speaks of him very appreciatively.[see Chap. VII].</p>
<p>Major General Macquarie was a controversial figure during his lifetime because of certain policies and measures which he put into effect in NSW. His enemies finally brought about his resignation, but history has almost wholly vindicated him. Today he is considered a really great man whose most serious fault was merely that he was ahead of his time.[see Chap. VIII].</p>
<p>It remains to speak briefly of some of the non-modern sources of information upon which we depended. The ancient Scots, like the Irish and other peoples of the olden time, preserved stories of their past in the form of oral tradition, instead of written history. Each court, Clan and district had its own storyteller, the sennachie, who together with a bard reduced the story to musical form. Gregg[23] describes their function: "The sennachies were the only custodians and historians of the tradition and genealogy of families... As their fund of information was handed down from father to son, without use of writing, only the most important events were kept.</p>
<p>"It was the custom for the sennachie to make a yearly round of the homes in his district and to relate the important events that had occurred since his previous visit. These related chiefly to births, deaths, marriages and transfers of property. As time went on, the sennachies began to put these accounts into written form. They met regularly... to compare and exchange records. The material thus gathered was put into permanent form... and forms today the only genuine history of ancient Scotland."</p>
<p>Mitchell[??] says: "To the highland Clans the office of sennachy was one of the highest importance, for upon the accuracy of his work depended... the rights of families. It was these pedigrees that demonstrated the relationship between individuals and the acknowledged father of the Clan, and upon that relationship depended the land each individual was entitled to hold".</p>
<p>For the dates and reigns of the early Scottish kings during the Celtic period we are dependent on several early chronicles. Many of these were edited and compared by the great scholar W.F. Skene (1809-1892). Skene, a lawyer by profession, gave much time to historical and archeological study. Since he believed the Scotch Highlanders were direct descendants of the Picts, he gave prominence to the Pictish Chronicle, Colbertine.</p>
<p>Another chronicle featured by Skene was, "Chronicle of the Scottish Nation" by John Fordoun (?-1384) a secular priest and chaplain in Aberdeen Cathedral. His was the earliest attempt to write a continuous history of Scotland, "all other efforts having resulted (merely) in brief chronicles of genealogical memoranda".</p>
<p>Andrew of Wyntoun (c1350-1420), Canon of St. Andrews and Prior of St. Serf's (Lochleven), and Fordoun share the distinction as fathers of Scottish history, though each worked independently. Wyntoun's work entitled, "The Orygynale Cronykill of Scotland", was written in metrical form and covered from mythical beginnings down to the accession of James I in 1406. Since it is in the vernacular speech of his day it has value for philology, and the later parts of it are very authoritative historically.</p>
<p>Hector Boece (1465-1536) wrote a 17-book "History of Scotland", "... a glorification of the Scottish nation, based on legendary sources, and is more interesting as romance than as history". Shakespeare's "MacBeth" is traceable to this by way of Holinshed who borrowed from it liberally. Boece claimed to have certain original histories of Scotland from the Abbey at Icolmkill, including Veremundas' whose writings have completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Raphael Holinshed (?-c1580), of England, wrote "The Scottish Chronicle", saying it was an accurate narration... of the Scottish nation from the original thereof unto the year 1585". An interesting book, it is not considered original nor particularly valuable as history.</p>
<p>The basic and oldest source for knowledge of St. Columba (?-597) is the biography by Abbot Adamnan (624-?). He came from Donegal, Ireland, the same general locality as did St. Columba and was 9th in succession after Columba as Abbot of Iona.</p>
