It allows users to:</p> <ul> <li>Zoom out to see the big picture of Scottish history</li> <li>Zoom in to focus on critical periods like 1745-1746</li> <li>Filter by category to see just Clan MacQuarrie events vs. broader Scottish history</li> <li>Navigate freely rather than clicking through 100 slides</li> </ul> <p>However, if you want maximum visual impact with less technical work, TimelineJS could still work---consider breaking it into multiple themed timelines (Jacobite Era, Australian Legacy, etc.).</p>"},{"location":"sims/","title":"List of Interactive Application","text":"<p>Timeline Viewer</p>"},{"location":"sims/timeline-viewer/","title":"Clan MacQuarrie Timeline Viewer","text":"<p>Run the Timeline Viewer</p>"}]}
