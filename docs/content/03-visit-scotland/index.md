Imagine standing on the rocky shores of a small Scottish island, looking out over the same waters your ancestors sailed centuries ago. For MacQuarrie descendants, visiting Scotland isn't just a vacation—it's a journey into your family's past. This chapter will help you plan a meaningful trip to explore your clan heritage, whether you're visiting the ancestral homeland of Ulva or exploring other significant sites across Scotland.

## Planning Your Visit to Mull and Ulva

### Is a Visit to Your Ancestors' Islands Right for You?

Before you book your flights, it's worth thinking about what you hope to gain from this journey. Visiting Ulva and the Isle of Mull isn't like going to a theme park or a regular tourist destination. These are remote, rural places where your ancestors lived simple lives connected to the land and sea.

A heritage visit to the MacQuarrie homeland offers three main rewards:

**History**: You'll walk the same paths your ancestors walked, see the ruins of their homes, and visit the places where major clan events occurred. The landscape itself tells the story of how the MacQuarries lived—fishing, farming, and fighting to maintain their independence.

**Adventure**: Getting to Ulva requires real effort. You'll take ferries, possibly small boats, and navigate rural roads. The island itself demands hiking boots and a spirit of exploration. If you enjoy outdoor adventures and don't mind unpredictable weather, you'll love it.

**Understanding**: Perhaps most importantly, visiting helps you understand why your ancestors lived the way they did. When you feel the wind coming off the Atlantic, see how isolated these islands are, and experience the harsh beauty of the Hebrides, you'll gain insight into the resilient character that defined Clan MacQuarrie.

If you prefer comfort, predictability, and easy access to amenities, you might want to focus on more accessible Scottish heritage sites like museums in Edinburgh or Glasgow. But if you're willing to embrace adventure for a deeper connection to your roots, Ulva is calling.

### Are You Up for Driving on the Left Side of the Road?

Here's something many American visitors underestimate: driving in Scotland, especially on single-track roads in the Highlands and islands, can be challenging. Not only do you drive on the left side of the road (opposite from the US and most of Europe), but rural Scottish roads are often:

- Extremely narrow, sometimes only wide enough for one car
- Winding with sharp turns and limited visibility
- Equipped with "passing places" where you must pull over to let oncoming traffic pass
- Bordered by stone walls, ditches, or steep drops with no shoulder

On Mull, many roads are single-track, meaning you'll need to be comfortable backing up if you meet another car between passing places. The roads can be stressful even for experienced drivers.

**Consider these options:**

- Rent a car only if you're confident about your driving skills and have practiced driving on the left
- Hire a local driver or join an organized tour
- Use public transportation where available (though it's limited on islands)
- Stay in one location and book day tours with transportation included

Don't let driving concerns stop you from visiting, but do plan realistically based on your comfort level.

### Understanding Travel Costs to Remote Islands

Let's be honest: visiting remote Scottish islands isn't cheap. Here's what to budget for:

**Transportation**:

- International flights to Scotland (Edinburgh or Glasgow): $600-1,500 depending on season and how far in advance you book
- Car rental: $40-80 per day, plus fuel (which is more expensive than in the US)
- Ferries to Mull: around £50-80 for a car and passengers round trip
- Small boat to Ulva: typically £5-15 per person
- Alternative: organized tours can cost $100-300 per day but include transportation

**Accommodation**:

- Hotels on Mull: $100-200 per night
- B&Bs (Bed and Breakfasts): $70-150 per night
- Self-catering cottages: $80-150 per night (good for families or longer stays)
- Budget hostels: $30-50 per night per person

**Food**:

- Restaurant meals: $15-30 per person
- Pub meals: $12-20 per person
- Groceries (if self-catering): similar to US prices, some items more expensive

**Total estimated cost**: For a week-long heritage trip including Ulva, budget $2,000-4,000 per person, depending on your accommodation choices and travel style.

The costs are higher because you're going to remote places with limited tourism infrastructure. However, the experience of connecting with your ancestral homeland is genuinely priceless.

### Setting Up Group Visits with Reliable Tour Organizations

If you're traveling with family members or want to connect with other MacQuarrie descendants, group tours can be both economical and meaningful. Several organizations specialize in heritage tourism to the Highlands and Islands:

**Rabbie's Tours** (rabbies.com) - Offers small-group day trips from Edinburgh and Glasgow to various Highland destinations, including Mull. They use small buses (16 passengers maximum) and knowledgeable guides.

**Highland Explorer Tours** (highlandexplorertours.com) - Provides customized tours for families and groups interested in clan heritage. They can create itineraries focused on specific clan sites.

**Clan Heritage Tours** - Some clan societies, including MacQuarrie organizations, occasionally organize group heritage tours. Check with the Clan MacQuarrie Society International for upcoming trips.

**Private guides** - Local historians and guides on Mull can provide personalized tours. Contact the Mull and Iona Tourism office for recommendations.

When booking a tour, make sure to:

- Specify your interest in MacQuarrie heritage
- Ask if the tour includes access to Ulva
- Confirm the guide's knowledge of clan history
- Check group size (smaller is usually better for heritage tours)
- Read recent reviews from other heritage tourists

### How to Get There (Transportation Options)

Getting to MacQuarrie homeland involves multiple stages. Here's the most common route:

**Stage 1: Reach Scotland**

- Fly into Edinburgh Airport (EDI) or Glasgow Airport (GLA)
- Both airports are well-connected internationally
- Edinburgh is about 3 hours from Oban (the ferry port for Mull)
- Glasgow is about 2 hours from Oban

**Stage 2: Get to Oban**

- Drive (if you rented a car at the airport)
- Take a train from Glasgow Queen Street station to Oban (about 3 hours, scenic route)
- Join a tour that includes transportation

**Stage 3: Ferry to Mull**

- Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac) operates ferries from Oban to Craignure on Mull
- Journey takes about 45 minutes
- Ferries run multiple times daily, but book ahead in summer
- You can bring a car or travel as a foot passenger

**Stage 4: Cross Mull to Ulva**

- Drive or bus across Mull (about 45 minutes to the Ulva ferry point)
- The scenery is spectacular, so allow extra time for stops

**Stage 5: Small Boat to Ulva**

- A small passenger ferry crosses the narrow strait to Ulva
- Runs during daylight hours, weather permitting
- No advance booking usually needed, but check current information
- Journey takes about 5 minutes

**Alternative routes**: You can also reach Mull via ferry from Lochaline (shorter crossing) or Kilchoan, though these require driving longer distances on the mainland.

### Key Websites That Hold Up-to-Date Travel Information

Because ferry schedules, road conditions, and tour availability change seasonally, always check these authoritative websites before and during your trip:

**Transportation**:

- CalMac Ferries: calmac.co.uk (essential for all ferry bookings and schedules)

- Traffic Scotland: traffic.gov.scot (road conditions and closures)

**Destination Information**:

- Isle of Mull: isle-of-mull.net (official tourism site)
- Ulva: ulva.scot (includes visitor information and history)
- VisitScotland: visitscotland.com (national tourism site with planning resources)

**Weather**:

- Booking.com, Airbnb (usual booking platforms work here)

**Save these websites to your phone before you travel**, as internet connectivity can be limited on the islands.

### Ferry and Boat Access

Understanding the ferry system is crucial for your visit:

**CalMac Ferries to Mull**:

- Require advance booking in summer (June-August) and holiday periods
- Accept bookings online, by phone, or at the port
- Car spaces are limited and fill quickly
- Foot passengers rarely have trouble getting aboard
- Fares vary by vehicle size and season
- Consider buying a Hopscotch ticket if visiting multiple islands

**Small Ferry to Ulva**:

- Much more informal than CalMac
- Cash payment on board (bring British pounds)
- No vehicles permitted on Ulva (you must walk)
- Weather dependent—crossings may be cancelled in high winds
- Usually operates April-October, limited winter service
- Check the Ulva website or call ahead to confirm operating days

**Pro tip**: Always have a backup plan. Island ferry services can be disrupted by weather, especially in winter. Build flexibility into your itinerary so a cancelled ferry doesn't ruin your trip.

### Best Times of Year to Visit

Each season offers different advantages for heritage visitors:

**Summer (June-August)**:

**Pros**: Longest days (light until 10 PM in June), warmest weather, all attractions open, ferries run frequently, wildflowers blooming

**Cons**: Most crowded and expensive, ferries and accommodations must be booked far ahead, midges (tiny biting insects) can be annoying

**Spring (April-May)**:

**Pros**: Fewer tourists, lower prices, landscape coming to life, reasonable daylight hours, baby lambs in fields

**Cons**: Weather still unpredictable, some facilities may have limited hours, can be chilly

**Fall (September-October)**:

**Pros**: Beautiful autumn colors, fewer midges, still relatively mild, harvest season, lower prices than summer

**Cons**: Days getting shorter, more rain likely, some attractions begin closing or reducing hours

**Winter (November-March)**:

**Pros**: Lowest prices, dramatic stormy scenery, authentic experience of island life, no crowds

**Cons**: Very short days (dark by 4 PM in December), cold and wet, many facilities closed, ferry schedules reduced, Ulva ferry may not operate

**Best overall choice**: Late May or early September offer the sweet spot of decent weather, manageable crowds, and most facilities being open.

**For heritage purposes specifically**: Any time you can visit works for seeing historical sites and landscapes. Ruins and burial grounds are accessible year-round. However, summer offers the best chances for connecting with local historians and joining guided tours.

### What to See on Ulva

Once you reach Ulva, what will you actually find? The island is small (about 4.6 square miles) and has only a few permanent residents, but it's rich with MacQuarrie heritage:

**The Boathouse Visitor Centre**:

**The Chief's Residence Area**:

- Ruins of the chief's dwelling, more substantial than ordinary cottages
- Located in a strategic position with views of the surrounding sea
- Interpretive signs explain the layout
- Bring your imagination—not much stands above ground level now

**Kildavie Church and Burial Ground**:

- Perhaps the most moving MacQuarrie site
- Ancient church ruins dating to medieval times
- Burial ground contains MacQuarrie graves
- Peaceful location overlooking the water

## MacQuarrie Historical Sites

Beyond Ulva, several locations hold significance for understanding MacQuarrie history:

### Map of Significant Locations

The key MacQuarrie sites cluster in Scotland's west coast and Inner Hebrides:

**The MacQuarrie Heartland**:

- **Ulva**: ancestral home and center of clan power (1400s-1794)
- **Isle of Mull**: larger neighboring island, closely connected to MacQuarrie history
- **Inch Kenneth**: small island near Ulva, also held by MacQuarries

**Battle and Historical Sites**:

- **Culloden Battlefield** (near Inverness): where Chief Allan MacQuarrie fought and died in 1746
- **Glenlivet** (Moray): site of 1594 battle where MacQuarries fought
- **Sheriffmuir** (near Stirling): 1715 Jacobite battle

**Later Historical Sites**:

- **London**: where Lachlan Macquarrie died in 1824
- **Sydney, Australia**: location of Lachlan Macquarie's governorship and legacy

Creating a complete MacQuarrie heritage tour would ideally include Ulva as the centerpiece, Culloden for understanding the clan's fateful choice, and Edinburgh for archival research and museum visits.

### Chief's Residence Ruins

On Ulva, the remains of the chief's residence tell a story of both power and modesty:

**What You'll See**:

- Stone foundation outlines of a substantial building, larger than typical clan members' homes
- Location chosen for both strategic and practical reasons: defendable yet accessible
- Nearby remains of outbuildings: possibly storage, animals, or retainers' quarters
- Evidence of stone construction, marking it as more permanent than simpler structures

**Historical Context**:

The MacQuarrie chiefs weren't wealthy by Lowland standards, but they were rich in clan bonds and land. Their residence would have been:

- The clan's administrative center where disputes were settled
- A gathering place for important clan decisions
- Home to the chief's family and immediate household
- A symbol of the clan's independence and identity

**What Happened Here**:

This was the home of the chiefs who:

- Maintained independence for centuries
- Made the fateful decision to support Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745
- Struggled with debt after Culloden
- Eventually sold the island in 1794, ending six centuries of MacQuarrie ownership

Standing in these ruins, you're at the heart of MacQuarrie history—where your ancestors made decisions that echo through generations.

### Settlement Sites

Scattered across Ulva are the remains of the small settlements where ordinary clan members lived:

**Typical Settlement Features**:

- Clusters of 3-10 blackhouses (traditional thatched cottages)
- Located near fresh water sources
- Sheltered from the worst Atlantic storms
- Close to arable land or good grazing
- Within reasonable distance of the shore for fishing

**Life in These Settlements**:

Your MacQuarrie ancestors lived in close-knit communities:

- Extended families occupied neighboring houses
- Shared labor for farming, fishing, and peat-cutting
- Spoke Gaelic as their everyday language
- Practiced a mix of farming, fishing, and raising cattle and sheep
- Lived largely self-sufficient lives dependent on the island's resources

**The Clearances' Impact**:

Many of these settlements were abandoned during the 19th century Highland Clearances:

- After the chief sold Ulva in 1794, new owners wanted to maximize profit
- Traditional farming communities were "cleared" to make way for large-scale sheep farming
- MacQuarrie descendants were forced to emigrate or move to coastal crofts
- By the late 1800s, Ulva's population had collapsed from over 500 to fewer than 50

Walking through these ruins, you're witnessing both the daily life of your ancestors and the tragedy that dispersed them across the globe.

### Burial Grounds and Memorials

**Kildavie Church and Burial Ground** on Ulva is the most significant MacQuarrie memorial site:

**What Makes It Special**:

- Ancient burial ground, used for centuries before and after the Reformation
- Multiple generations of MacQuarries rest here
- Church ruins date to medieval times, showing the clan's religious history
- Peaceful location that connects visitors with ancestors in a profound way

**What You'll Find**:

- Old gravestones, many weathered beyond reading
- Some identifiable MacQuarrie markers
- The general burial area of clan members (many graves unmarked, as was common)
- Atmosphere of continuity linking past and present

**Visitor Etiquette**:

- This is still a sacred place; be respectful
- Walk carefully to avoid stepping on graves
- Take photographs if you wish, but maintain dignity
- Many visitors leave small stones or flowers
- Take time for quiet reflection on your ancestors' lives

**Other Memorial Sites**:

- **Culloden Battlefield**: features a memorial cairn where Highland clans, including MacQuarrie, are commemorated
- **National Wallace Monument** (near Stirling): recognizes all Scottish clans' contributions to independence
- **Australian memorials**: numerous sites in Australia honor Lachlan Macquarie's contributions

### Churches and Religious Sites

Religion played a complex role in MacQuarrie history:

**Medieval Period**:

- MacQuarries were Catholic before the Reformation
- Connected to Iona Abbey's religious influence
- Small chapels served island communities
- Kildavie Church on Ulva was the clan's primary place of worship

**After the Reformation (1560)**:

- Scotland became Protestant
- Highland clans adapted more slowly than Lowlands
- Religious tensions influenced clan politics
- MacQuarries' support of Catholic-leaning Jacobites partly reflected these divisions

**Sites to Visit**:

**Iona Abbey** (near Mull):

- One of Scotland's most important religious sites
- Founded by St. Columba in 563 CE
- The spiritual center of Hebridean Christianity
- Influenced MacQuarrie religious life for centuries
- Beautiful restored abbey open to visitors
- Reachable by ferry from Mull (worth the trip even though not specifically MacQuarrie)

**Tobermory Church** (Mull):

- Historic church serving Mull communities
- Records may contain MacQuarrie baptisms, marriages, and deaths
- Victorian-era building replacing earlier structures

**St. Giles' Cathedral** (Edinburgh):

- Scotland's "Mother Kirk"
- Center of Scottish Presbyterian church
- Represents the religious world MacQuarries navigated after 1560

Understanding the religious landscape helps explain why MacQuarries made the choices they did, especially their support of Jacobite causes that had strong Catholic connections.

### Sites of Famous Battles - The Battle of Culloden

**Culloden Battlefield** deserves special emphasis as the most important MacQuarrie battlefield site:

**Historical Significance**:

On April 16, 1746, the Jacobite army under Prince Charles Edward Stuart faced the British government forces on Culloden Moor near Inverness. The battle lasted less than an hour and ended in crushing defeat for the Jacobites. This battle changed Highland history forever.

Chief Allan MacQuarrie led his clan members in the battle. Although they fought bravely, the MacQuarries suffered heavy casualties. Chief Allan himself died either during the battle or shortly after, ending the line of MacQuarrie chiefs who had ruled Ulva for over 300 years.

**What the Battle Meant**:

- End of the Jacobite cause to restore Stuart monarchy
- Beginning of systematic destruction of clan system
- Laws passed to ban Highland dress, weapons, and traditions
- Government seized clan lands
- Highland way of life fundamentally changed
- Many MacQuarries emigrated or were dispersed
- Within 50 years, MacQuarries had lost Ulva

Many MacQuarrie descendants find visiting Culloden deeply moving. This is where your ancestors made their last stand for a cause they believed in. Understanding the bravery and tragedy of that day helps explain why the clan's fortunes declined so dramatically afterward.

## Practical Information

### Weather and What to Bring

**Understanding Scottish Weather**:

Scottish weather, especially in the Hebrides, is famously unpredictable. The saying goes: "If you don't like the weather, wait ten minutes." Here's what to expect:

**By Season**:

**Summer (June-August)**:

- Temperatures: 55-65°F (13-18°C), occasionally warmer
- Longest days, light until late evening
- Still significant rain possible
- Wind often strong, especially on coasts
- Can be warm enough for t-shirts, but bring layers

**Spring/Fall (April-May, September-October)**:

- Temperatures: 45-55°F (7-13°C)
- More frequent rain
- Rapidly changing conditions
- Shorter days (especially October)
- Can be beautiful or miserable, sometimes both in one day

**Winter (November-March)**:

- Temperatures: 35-45°F (2-7°C), rarely below freezing at sea level
- Short days (dark by 4 PM in December)
- Frequent rain, occasional snow
- Storms can be severe
- Ferry cancellations more common

**Key Weather Facts**:

- Rain is possible every single day of the year
- Wind is constant, especially on islands
- Horizontal rain (wind-driven) is common
- Multiple weather conditions in a single day
- Weather changes rapidly—be prepared for anything

**Essential Clothing and Gear**:

**Absolutely Critical**:

- **Waterproof jacket with hood**: not water-resistant, truly waterproof (your most important item)
- **Waterproof hiking boots**: ankle support, good tread, broken in before the trip
- **Waterproof pants**: especially if hiking extensively
- **Layers**: temperature varies throughout the day
- **Warm fleece or wool sweater**: even in summer, mornings and evenings are cool
- **Gloves and warm hat**: useful even in summer on windy days
- **Sunglasses and sunscreen**: when sun appears, it can be strong

**Recommended**:

- Quick-dry clothing (cotton takes forever to dry)
- Extra socks (feet will get wet)
- Small backpack for day trips
- Water bottle
- Midges repellent (summer visits)
- Binoculars for wildlife watching
- Camera in waterproof bag or case
- Power bank for phone charging (outlets scarce on day trips)

**What NOT to Bring**:

- Umbrella (useless in wind, will blow inside out)
- Heavy suitcases (lots of walking and stairs)
- Fancy dress clothes (very casual environment)
- Expectations of consistent weather

**Packing Strategy**:

Think in terms of layers:

1. **Base layer**: synthetic or wool (not cotton)
2. **Middle layer**: fleece or wool for warmth
3. **Outer layer**: waterproof jacket
4. **Add or remove layers** throughout the day

This system lets you adapt as weather changes without needing different outfits.

- Your privilege to visit these sites comes from others' pain
- Approach with humility and respect

**Avoid**:

- Treating sites as theme parks
- Making insensitive jokes about poverty or suffering
- Romanticizing the past inappropriately
- Claiming connection to clan culture inappropriately
- "Playing Highland" in ways that might offend Scots

**Interacting with Locals**:

**Good Practices**:

**Conversation Tips**:

- Scots appreciate genuine interest
- Avoid stereotyping
- Don't claim to be "Scottish" if you're several generations removed

**A Final Thought on Etiquette**:

Remember that you're visiting places your ancestors lived, worked, fought, died, and were buried. Approach every site as if your own great-great-grandparents might be watching your behavior—because in a very real sense, through the connection of heritage and family, they are. Your visit should honor their memory and preserve these places for future MacQuarrie descendants who will follow in your footsteps.

## Conclusion

Visiting Scotland to explore your MacQuarrie heritage is more than a vacation—it's a pilgrimage to your roots. Whether you make it to the windswept shores of Ulva, stand solemnly at Culloden where Chief Allan fell, or explore museums in Edinburgh, you're walking in the footsteps of your ancestors.

The journey may be challenging. The weather will be unpredictable. The roads will be narrow. The ferries will run on island time. But when you stand on Ulva, looking out at the same Atlantic waters your ancestors gazed upon for centuries, when you walk through the ruins of their homes and visit their graves, you'll understand something profound about who you are and where you came from.

The MacQuarries may have lost their island, but they never lost their identity. They scattered across the world—to Australia, Canada, the United States, New Zealand—carrying their heritage with them. Your visit to Scotland closes a circle, bringing that heritage back home, even if only for a brief time.

Plan carefully, respect the sites you visit, and approach your journey with an open heart. Scotland is waiting to share its stories with you, and your MacQuarrie ancestors are waiting to be remembered.
